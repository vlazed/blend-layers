## Description

This adds an overlay shader, which allows one to add layers with different blend modes. You can find in `Post Process > Shaders > Overlay (vlazed)`

### Features

- **Layer system**: Add different image layers on screen
- **Blending modes**: Set how layers blend into each other
- **Image file browser**: Find images within GMod for overlays
- **Presets (WIP)**: Save layer presets into json files, which you can share with friends or distribute on the Steam Workshop

### Rational

Simple overlays require a bit of coding expertise. This shader allows one to make their own overlays.

### Remarks

This shader supports the screen blending mode. Thus, one can preview their soft lamps renders.

When making a pull request, make sure to confine to the style seen throughout. Try to add types for new functions or data structures. I used the default [StyLua](https://github.com/JohnnyMorganz/StyLua) formatting style.
